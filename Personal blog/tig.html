                    <h2>TIGER</h2>
                     
                    <p>
                        The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest cat species and a member of the Panthera genus. Here's some information about tigers:

1. Physical Characteristics: Tigers are known for their distinctive orange coat with black stripes, which helps them blend into their surroundings. They have muscular bodies with a length of around 3 to 3.9 meters (9.8 to 12.8 feet) and can weigh between 120 to 300 kilograms (260 to 660 pounds), depending on the subspecies.

2. Habitat: Tigers are native to various parts of Asia, including countries such as India, Russia, China, and Indonesia. They inhabit a range of ecosystems, including tropical rainforests, grasslands, mangrove swamps, and taiga forests.

3. Subspecies: There are several subspecies of tigers, including the Bengal tiger, Siberian tiger, Indochinese tiger, Malayan tiger, and Sumatran tiger. Each subspecies has specific adaptations to its particular habitat.

4. Behavior and Diet: Tigers are solitary animals and are known for their hunting prowess. They are carnivores and primarily prey on large ungulates such as deer, wild boar, and water buffalo. Tigers are ambush predators and use their strength, speed, and powerful jaws to bring down their prey.

5. Conservation Status: Tigers are considered an endangered species. Habitat loss, poaching for their fur and body parts (used in traditional medicine), and conflicts with humans have significantly reduced their population in the wild. Conservation efforts and initiatives are being implemented to protect and increase tiger populations.

6. Cultural Significance: Tigers hold significant cultural and symbolic value in many Asian countries. They feature prominently in mythology, folklore, and religious beliefs. The tiger is the national animal of several countries, including India, Bangladesh, Malaysia, and South Korea.

7. Captive Tigers: Some tigers are kept in captivity in zoos and wildlife reserves around the world. These institutions play a crucial role in conservation, research, and public education about tigers and their habitat.

It's important to note that my knowledge cutoff is in September 2021, so any recent developments or changes in the tiger population may not be reflected in the information provided.
